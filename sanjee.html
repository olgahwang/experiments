        <p>Somewhere in the middle of Greate Steppe Sanjee was born.
          With the smell of grass, horses, milk and freedom.
          Two bright dark eyes were staring at the world full of wonder and kindness.
          Hid little heart bit the rhythm: knock-knock. Supernova Sanjee was born.

        <p style="color: #535353;">All men have stars, but they are not the same things for
          different people. For some, who are travelers, the stars
          are guides. For others they are no more than little lights in the sky.
          For others, who are scholars, they are problems... But all these stars
          are silent. You-You alone will have stars as no one else has them.<br><br>
          I wish you will never stop wondering and exploring your starts. Always
          stay hungry, stay foolish.

        We are full of fears: being imperfect, being not good enough, making something
        wrong, being too chaotic. Don't afraid of it. Be brave, embrace chaos and let it
        make something unique, real and fascinating.

      Just remember all the incredible things you did. Remember how you always
      made something that seemed impossible, how you led people, made
      them believe and create. Remember those magical moments, that create
      piece by piece the life of Supernova Sanjee. <br><br>
      I wish you to have life full of dreams, fruitful experiences, interesing
      and different people. I wish you never stop growing, developing and creating.
      Be self, listen to your heart and be brave to strive for all the dreams you have.
